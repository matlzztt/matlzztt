### Societies of Control through Proprietary Software: A Left Accelerationist Perspective

The shift from disciplinary societies to control societies, as outlined by Gilles Deleuze, marks a significant transformation in the mechanisms of power and control. In the contemporary digital era, proprietary software exemplifies the pervasive control mechanisms characteristic of control societies. This essay explores how proprietary software perpetuates control and how the enforcement of the GNU General Public License (GPL) can serve as a countermeasure, aligned with Left Accelerationist ethics.

#### Historical Context: From Disciplinary to Control Societies

Michel Foucault’s concept of disciplinary societies revolves around institutions like the family, school, factory, and prison, each imposing specific rules and norms to produce disciplined individuals. These institutions operate within enclosed spaces, transitioning individuals from one environment to another, each with its own set of regulations.

Deleuze expanded on Foucault’s ideas, identifying the emergence of control societies in the mid-20th century. Control societies, unlike their disciplinary predecessors, do not rely on enclosed spaces but on continuous modulation and surveillance. Power in control societies is exercised through flexible and pervasive systems, adapting to and influencing individuals' behaviors in real time.

#### Proprietary Software as a Mechanism of Control

Proprietary software embodies the essence of control societies by restricting access, usage, and modification of software through legal and technical means. This creates a closed system where control is maintained by the software owners, reinforcing dependency and surveillance.

1. **Restricted Access and Transparency**:
    - **Closed Source Code**: Proprietary software keeps its source code hidden, preventing users from understanding, modifying, or improving the software. This lack of transparency consolidates control in the hands of the software owners.
    - **Surveillance and Data Collection**: Proprietary software often includes terms that allow for extensive data collection and surveillance, further entrenching the power dynamics of control societies.

2. **Dependence and Continuous Modulation**:
    - **Licensing Agreements**: Users of proprietary software are bound by licensing agreements that dictate how the software can be used, modified, and distributed. These agreements ensure that control is maintained even after the software is purchased.
    - **Updates and Digital Rights Management (DRM)**: Proprietary software relies on updates and DRM to enforce control, modulating users’ access and functionality over time. This continuous modulation aligns with Deleuze’s description of control societies.

3. **Economic and Social Implications**:
    - **Monopolistic Practices**: Proprietary software often leads to monopolistic practices, where a few corporations dominate the market, stifling competition and innovation.
    - **Social Inequality**: The control exerted by proprietary software exacerbates social inequalities, as access to technology and its benefits are unevenly distributed.

#### The GNU General Public License (GPL) as a Countermeasure

The GPL offers an alternative to the proprietary model by promoting transparency, freedom, and collective ownership. Enforcing GPL compliance can mitigate the control mechanisms inherent in proprietary software, aligning with Left Accelerationist ethics.

1. **Transparency and Accessibility**:
    - **Open Source Code**: GPL ensures that software source code is available to all, promoting transparency and collective improvement. This openness challenges the secrecy of proprietary software.
    - **Empowerment through Knowledge**: By making source code accessible, GPL empowers individuals to understand, modify, and improve software, fostering a more informed and autonomous user base.

2. **Freedom from Control**:
    - **User Autonomy**: GPL grants users the freedom to use, study, modify, and distribute software, breaking the dependency on software owners and reducing continuous modulation.
    - **Decentralization of Power**: By promoting open source, GPL decentralizes technological power, distributing it among a global community rather than a few corporations.

3. **Collective Ownership and Innovation**:
    - **Communal Resource**: GPL-treated software becomes a communal resource, reflecting Left Accelerationist ideals of collective ownership and use. This communal approach contrasts sharply with the privatization inherent in proprietary software.
    - **Accelerated Innovation**: The collaborative environment fostered by GPL accelerates innovation, as developers worldwide can contribute to and improve software.

#### Left Accelerationist Ethics and the GPL

From a Left Accelerationist perspective, enforcing GPL compliance embodies several ethical principles:

- **Resistance to Control**: GPL creates a form of resistance against the pervasive control mechanisms of proprietary software, promoting autonomy and transparency.
- **Promotion of Collective Good**: GPL aligns with Left Accelerationist ethics by promoting the collective good over individual profit, ensuring that technological advancements benefit society as a whole.
- **Empowerment through Knowledge**: GPL democratizes technology, allowing more people to participate in and benefit from technological progress.

### Conclusion

Proprietary software, as a mechanism of control societies, perpetuates dependency, surveillance, and social inequality. The enforcement of GPL compliance offers a powerful counter-narrative, promoting transparency, freedom, and collective ownership. From a Left Accelerationist perspective, GPL aligns with ethical principles that resist control, promote the collective good, and empower individuals through knowledge. Embracing and enforcing GPL can challenge the dominance of control societies and pave the way for a more equitable and democratic technological future.
